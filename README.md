# haskell-ffi-cookbook
A collection of FFI examples

Donate your code, commits are welcome.

Preferrably donate working code examples, something that illustrates a particular FFI usage.  

The goal is to aggregate a good amount of (working) examples that can become a cookbook or a reference for wiki, FFI book, etc.

Motivation: wikis and books are slow to write and edit.  Commiting a code snippet is relatively easy.
